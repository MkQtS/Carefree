Based on FlyDonkey's skin: [theSimpleThing2](https://www.deviantart.com/flydonkey/art/444035536). I'd sent him few e-mails, and his suggestions were useful. Thanks a million.

Skin features:

1. Transparent interface & centered Play/Pause botton;
2. Search box, album switch & bottom tab in Playlist;
3. New Control Panel, Capture window and Scrollbar;
4. Dynamic effect when loading a file and playing an audio;
5. Compact main menu, you can disable it anyway;
6. Guidance for "On Screen Control";
7. Time information in the upper left corner of the window, right click it to add a task;
8. Window size limit: 320x180(100%DPI);
9. Supported languages: English, simplified & traditional Chinese

You are supposed to choose "Direct3D 9" in "On Screen Control", or choose "Layered Window Mode" when the skin doesn't work(It may happen when madVR is working).
